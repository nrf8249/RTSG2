Exercise 01 Learning Report

From this exercise, I refreshed my JavaScript coding skills, using essential coding
terminology such as: if, if else, function, etc.

I think if I were to do something better or more efficiently, it would be to try and 
find a way to use a switch statment to determine which outcome to produce, rather than
a series of if and else statements.
